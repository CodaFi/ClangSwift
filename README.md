# ClangSwift
[![Documentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/llvm-swift/ClangSwift/master/docs/badge.svg)](https://llvm-swift.github.io/ClangSwift)

ClangSwift aims to be a Swifty wrapper for the `libclang` C API, much like
[LLVMSwift](https://github.com/llvm-swift/LLVMSwift).

It's still heavily in development, and is nowhere near complete.
Check back for updates!
