# ClangSwift
[![Documentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/trill-lang/ClangSwift/master/docs/badge.svg)](https://trill-lang.github.io/ClangSwift)

ClangSwift aims to be a Swifty wrapper for the `libclang` C API, much like
[LLVMSwift](https://github.com/trill-lang/LLVMSwift).

It's still heavily in development, and is nowhere near complete.
Check back for updates!
